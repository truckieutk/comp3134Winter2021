1.
The result is given as expected because the database get the query and there is a row with first name has matched the query search.

2.
The query will turn into 
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE firstname='Ben'-- '
In this scenario, the attacker is using SQL comment syntax. The remaining code after the double-dash (--) sequence will not run. Meaning an SQL would be:
		
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE firstname='Ben';
		
It will then return user data that was entered in the password field. This move could allow the login screen to be bypassed.

3.
The query will turn into
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username='james' OR 1=1;
The query returns a non-empty dataset for any potential access with the entire "Users" table database.
