In the csfr.html:
The information is sent and stored in the web server without any hidden field to compare the value.
Therefore, it is less security to match if this is a valid submission.

In the csfr_form:

The web server generates a token and stores it
The token is statically set as a hidden field of the form
The form is submitted by the user
The token is included in the POST request data
The application compares the token generated and stored by the application with the token sent in the request
If these tokens match, the request is valid
If these tokens do not match, the request is invalid and is rejected
