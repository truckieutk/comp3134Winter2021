We can remove all HTML and PHP tags from a string or remove only a selection of them. The built-in function strip_tags() takes a string in which to remove the tags and optionally another string that pinpoints which tags are allowed.

htmlspecialchars() takes a string and as optional parameters – ‘flags’, the ‘encoding’ to be used when converting the characters and a ‘double encoding’ option which is set to true by default and when turned off forces PHP not to encode existing HTML entities.

htmlentities translates all HTML characters entity equivalents to the particular entities.
